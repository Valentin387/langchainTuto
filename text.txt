Summary

👋 Hello, I'm Valentin Valencia, and I believe in the power of connecting people, ideas, and technology. 🌐

📚 With a foundation in academic excellence, I graduated with honors from Colegio Salesiano San Juan Bosco and embarked on a journey of continuous learning. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems and Computing Engineering at Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, where I'm passionate about harnessing technology to drive innovation.

🌍 My horizons expanded during an eye-opening academic exchange at L'École de Technologie Supérieure in Montreal, Canada, where I delved into the realm of génie en technologies de l'information.

💬 I'm not just proficient in one language; I'm a trilingual communicator. Fluent in Spanish, English (certified at C1 level by the British Council's APTIS test), and French (certified as DALF C1 by L'Alliance Française), I bridge cultural gaps and collaborate seamlessly on a global scale.

💻 My skills shine in the realm of full-stack development with a focus on backend technologies. I'm adept with tools like Spring Boot, Vue.js, Expo, Django, MySQL, GitKraken, and I ensure the smoothest collaboration through DevOps and GitHub Kanban. I also hold a Cisco CCNA Introduction to Networks badge.

🤝 Collaboration is my forte. Whether leading a team or working alongside passionate colleagues, I relish the opportunity to drive progress and make exciting projects a reality.

🙌 The values I cherish most are honesty, consistency, respect, and responsibility, and I seek these qualities in those I work with.

✈️ My experience living abroad has honed my adaptability, allowing me to seamlessly integrate into new environments, navigate diverse social norms, and embrace emerging technologies.

🥋 Beyond my digital pursuits, I love physical and mental exercise, practicing Taekwondo and cycling to cultivate resilience and determination. My love for movies, books, history, diverse cultures, and languages fuels my passion for meaningful conversations.

🌟 Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and make a difference together. Whether you're interested in technology, languages, or simply sharing a great book recommendation, I'm always eager to connect and expand my horizons.

Looking forward to connecting and embarking on exciting journeys together! 🚀🌎 #OpenToOpportunities #TechEnthusiast #LanguageLover #TeamPlayer
